Hey there! 👋  
Welcome to my little corner of the VLSI world.

I'm **Amit Suryavanshi**, a **PG Diploma Student at IIIT Bangalore** and currently a **trainee at FutureWiz** (part of **Truechip Solutions** family).  
This repository is **not just a project folder** — it's a **living journal** of my learning journey through **VLSI design**, **verification**, and **embedded systems** 🚀.

## 🛠 The KVLSI Program - My Launchpad  

> "**KVLSI**" is more than a course — it's a **mission** initiated by the Government of Karnataka,  
> supported by **MINRO-IIITB**, **SFAL**, **IESA**, and many more visionaries.  
>   
> **Training Partner:** *FutureWiz (Truechip Solutions)*

Through this program, I transitioned from **textbook theories** to **industry-grade VLSI practices**, blending **academia and hands-on** experience beautifully.  
Each module, each lab session, and each project shaped a stronger engineer inside me! 🌱
