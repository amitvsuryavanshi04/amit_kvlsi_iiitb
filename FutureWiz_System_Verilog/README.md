# FutureWiz_System_Verilog

This repository contains structured SystemVerilog code, testbenches, and theory resources aimed at helping learners and developers understand and verify digital design concepts. The folder organization reflects a progressive learning path from basic theory to advanced verification techniques.

## Folder Structure

### `sv_daily_codes/`
Daily practice SystemVerilog codes covering various design and testbench examples for hands-on learning.

### `theory/`
Conceptual notes, explanations, and diagrams covering fundamental and advanced topics in digital design and SystemVerilog.

### `verification_testbench_architectures_combinational_circuits/`
Testbenches and verification architectures specifically targeting combinational logic circuits (e.g., multiplexers, decoders, adders).

### `verification_testbench_architectures_sequential_circuits/`
Verification testbenches for sequential logic circuits (e.g., flip-flops, counters, FSMs), focusing on timing and state behavior.
