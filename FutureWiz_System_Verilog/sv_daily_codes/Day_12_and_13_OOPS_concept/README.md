# 🎯 OOPS Concepts in SystemVerilog

SystemVerilog supports **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, enhancing code **modularity**, **reuse**, and **scalability**—essential for complex verification and modeling.  
This folder currently includes **two core pillars** of OOP, with clean examples and usage demonstrations.

---

## 📌 1. Inheritance 🧬

> **Definition**: Inheritance allows a **child class (derived class)** to access properties and methods from a **parent class (base class)**.

🔹 Promotes **code reusability**  
🔹 Supports **hierarchical relationships**  
🔹 Simplifies **maintenance and extension** of existing code  

📁 _Check the example to understand how child classes inherit and override functionality from base classes in SV._

---

## 📌 2. Polymorphism 🌀

> **Definition**: Polymorphism allows methods of the **child class** to be accessed using a **parent class handle**—letting **parent behave like a child**.

🔹 Enables **dynamic method dispatch** using `virtual` methods  
🔹 Supports **flexibility in code behavior at runtime**  
🔹 Reduces **tight coupling** between testbench components

- 🔐 **Encapsulation**  
- 🧠 **Abstraction**
